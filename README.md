## What You Need To Do (In Order)

### 1. Fork this repository

- On GitHub, click **Fork** so you get your own copy under your account.
- Clone **your fork** (not the original) to your machine and work there.

### 2. Update the code

- Replace the template text with **your project**: problems, solution, MVP, revenue model, team names, credits, etc.
- Add your **project review video** (embed URL) in the Video section.
- Point the **feedback form** button to your actual form link.
- Use the sections as intended: Problems, Solution, Video, MVP (at least 4), Revenue (if any), Credits.

### 3. Fix any errors

- Run the app locally (`pnpm install` then `pnpm dev`) and fix any build or runtime errors.
- Run `pnpm build` and make sure it passes. Fixing errors counts toward your score.

### 4. Create a new branch and push your work

- Do **not** work on `main` (or `master`). Create a new branch, for example:
  - `git checkout -b my-pitch-deck` // imp write your name or your team leader name as the branch name with last three digits of your contact number
- Commit your changes and push the branch to **your fork**:
  - `git push -u origin my-pitch-deck`
- VERY IMP : Make sure you merge your main  with your newly made branch while not deleting the branch itself.

### 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)

- On GitHub, open a **Pull Request** from your branch/main (e.g. `my-pitch-deck`) **toward the original repository** (the one you forked from).
- Fill in the PR title and description so it’s clear what you changed.
- Note: PRs will not be merged, but **creating the PR is part of the evaluation**. You are expected to fork, update, branch, and open a PR.

### 6. Host the site on Vercel

- Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in (e.g. with GitHub).
- **Import** your forked repository and deploy. Vercel will detect Next.js and build it.
- Use the default settings if you’re unsure. After deploy, you’ll get a live URL.
- **Deploying successfully on Vercel** is part of your score.
- IMP : Make sure you off the vercel authentication in settings.
